This repo contains the code for completing the programming assignments in the Coursera course of Machine Learning (Regression). 
[Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression/)

The assignments are not completed using the numpy, sklearn modules in python. The code is provided in notebooks, since it's easier to follow. 
Unless otherwise mentioned in some notebook, the GraphLab module is not used at all.
